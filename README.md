<h1>This is an Interpreter in csharp</h1>
It is currently not complete, but when it is, this shall be changed.

I really had the curiosity to how interpreters and compilers worked, so i'm trying to build it!

I also have an interest on building it for future languages that i want to learn. 
Since it is a very fun project, with a lot of cool concepts!
